Abstractions to use for color / frame / fixture

Color: 
 * It's not useful to have an abstract Color. Too many effects need to use a concrete representation like RGB.

Frame / model:

Requirements:
 - Support layering. The chosen model is hierarchical: the "top" layer may depend on other layers,
   and combines the results from them. The output loop only ever deals with one layer, but this 
   may have many layers beneath it.
    * Consequently, Layers can't write directly to the output buffer. Each layer must have a 
      complete representation of the output structure (Model).
