# Rotel amplifier binding

Connects to a Rotel RA11 or RA12 amplifier via a serial interface.

To use it, connect a serial cable between the amplifier and the computer.

Channel summary:
* Power on/off (soft)
* Volume. Percentage mapped to level. Max level is user selectable (on RA11 the max is 96, but it may make sense to use 100 then).
* Mute channel.
* Source: Selects one of the analogue or digital input channels.
* Frequency: information only, shows the sampling frequency of the digital input stream.
* Dimmer: Select the backlight level of the LCD.

All channels are updated in real time if modified from outside of OpenHAB.
