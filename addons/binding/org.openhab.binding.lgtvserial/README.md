# LG TV control using serial port

This simple binding can send some commands typically used by LG LCD TVs (and some used by projectors).

* On/off
* Input
* Volume
* Mute
* Backlight brightness
* Color temperature

The binding does not support querying the values from the TV.

Usage: connect the TV to the computer using a serial cable. This may require a port adapter if
using a 3.5mm jack. Enter the serial port name in the configuration.
